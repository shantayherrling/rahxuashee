Local k Top 4 with Bant Spirits amp#x200B; Decklist ( amp#x200B; Five Months out: SCG Worcester, January 2019. I’m on Bant Spirits. I love that deck—the ability to switch between Tempo and Aggro gameplans is fantastic, and Collected Company and Spell Queller are both some of my favorite Magic cards. The deck has just gotten a huuuuge power boost from Deputy of Detention, and I’m hyped She borrowed the book from him many years ago and hasn't yet returned it. The waves were crashing on the shore; it was a lovely sight. Christmas is coming. I checked to make sure that he was still alive. She did her best to help him. Everyone was busy, so I went to the movie alone. Lets all be unique together until we realise we are all the same. I will never be this young again. Ever. Oh damn… I just got older. We have never been to Asia, nor have we visited Africa. She was too short Ok, so mixed reviews on Chapter 1, mostly bad. Some more background. I wrote this as a novel when I was a lot younger. It was meant for the general public, not poker players but I ended up not sharing it with anyone, ever. You should have kept it that way . Eh, maybe, but if one person reads it and gets some enjoyment, then I'm happy and I'll be even happier if more people post stories. Don't waste your time if you don't like the style. Sorry about the wall of text, when I paste Jake had many friends, but one of his favorite crackers was Will Heath. Jake was able to acquire all the credit cards Jayson had planned to give him, but he knew Will’s dad had immense wealth, which would help with the fight against Calhoun. Jake wandered around Moosup and ended up at a Cumberland Farms. He needed some more GFuel to stay awake, Calhoun could be around any corner waiting for him. After the male cashier tried flirting with Jake, he hesitantly decided to go to Will’s house. Hi everyone, a while ago I asked for funny or interesting football words in your languages in the daily discussion thread. I promised I'd make a text post about it but kind of forgot, better late then never, eh? Please contribute as well, I'm sure there are many more languages with hilarious or interesting football words, this is just a small list I gathered today. If there are any mistakes, let me know. I'll be adding new entries as we go. So without further ado: __________________________. Welcome to the 75th Lets Build !

Hey all. This is just sort of a catch-all post containing several thoughts/observations/questions/gripes/etc. about this amazing game with my 3rd playthrough of the single player campaign nearly complete (well, the main story anyway-- I've got about 4-5 missions left in Chapter 6). I'll probably do another one after this finishes, in addition to my free-roaming sessions as both Arthur (Chapter 2) and John (post-Epilogue; I'm going to use this playthrough for that save because 20 million years ago, an ape-like creature inhabited the Earth. And the ape stood, and became man. The greatest calamity that could befall early man was the loss of fire. Fire, the mysterious phenomenon that cooked his food, heated his cave, and kept him alive. If he could not start a fire, he and his would surely die. Even in most primitive man, the need to create was part of his nature. This need, this talent, clearly separated early man from animals who would never know this gift. The queens are well under way, sitting in pairs to brainstorm ideas with their assigned bandmate. Del, who seems to be working the hardest is seen sifting through a pile of horror films that Tish and Anita left out for the girls to use for inspiration and reference. Del’s partner, Harry, seems to wreak havoc around the werkroom, singing loudly obnoxiously and roaming around to distract other groups. The other groups roll their eyes as he approaches them, as they’re trying to get themselves. Original post was in r/justnomil but the mods removed it due to the fact that it is less about my MIL as a whole and more about my DH‘s entire disgustingly horrible family. The mods recommended that I post it here, so I am reposting with the hopes that someone out there has gone through something similar and can give some advice Alright. So my tale is years in the making…but I have lurked on here long enough to know that there is some great advice to be had here, so I’m putting. I’m the one who shot and killed my old boss, former Elk Lake sheriff Matt Jenkins. It was a clean, by the book shot. Not only was the shooting clear, I got a citation for heroism in the line of duty for how I performed that night. I have never felt more righteous about anything in my life than I do about that kill shot. I’m sorry that nothing can bring his son, Matt Jr, back. There is a lot about that horrifying crime scene that has leaked out into the media, but there are some things When I was thinking about that stupid headband from JNmom that reappeared in my life the other day, I was reminded of some shit that Pee Stick pulled a few years ago. We'll say over 7ish years ago, we were still just dating, but I'd stay over the weekends with DH to get away from my mom, as her bf would be home to care for her. His mom hated this and did protest it a few times but DH was paying rent to the homeowner and lived in the finished basement bedroom with a bathroom and fridge. I wasn't. ## What this is: This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either: - newly posted in the past 7 days , or - ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow) and have at least a fighting chance of being funded. All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!) Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm 
Six weeks ago my father passed away. While going through his things I found the following letter. amp#x200B; Ever since Caroline died my children have been insisting that I find some way of occupying my time. They've suggested painting, cooking, tai chi. Samantha even suggested ballroom dancing and then turned bright red when she realized that ballroom dancing is typically a couple's activity. None of it appeals to me. I'm old and I'm retired. I have no intention of starting any new chapte. Janett Christman was born on March 21, 1936. She was the oldest daughter of Charles and Lula Christman, with a younger sister by 18-months, Reta Christman Smith and a newborn baby, Cheryl Christman Bottorff. The young family of five had been living in Boonville, Missouri before relocating to the small, college-oriented town known of Columbia, Missouri, known for its football team, Missouri (Mizzou) Tigers, and were living on the upper floor of the business they owned, Ernie's Cafe and Steakhous. In my last list, "Top 30 Most Played Games on Android by DAU" (Daily Active Users) https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/9p8vxj/top_30_most_played_games_on_android_by_dau/ it became clear that India, as the biggest Android market the list gathered it numbers from was having a pretty big impact on the final placings. Some games had such high DAU's in India they would have made that top 30 list without any help from any other countries. This list was pretty easy to make since In front of the gaunt selection of spirits, I wish I could hibernate and just sleep through winter. Constant cold and darkness just make me feel depressed. The constant cold and darkness framing the shit neighborhood I live in depress me even more. I feel exotic, so –on the way home- I am carrying a bottle of tequila. I walk the short distance that separates the off-license shop to my building dreaming of how I would spend a fortune, if I had it. If I am honest, if I had spent. 
Sharing the article here, because of paywall: -- The art of Warne By GIDEON HAIGH THEAUSTRALIAN 11:00PM OCTOBER 19, 2012 EIGHT paces: that's all it was. And only the last few counted. Shane Warne's bowling action was seen more than 50,000 times in international cricket. Yet it never ceased to beguile and excite - that something so simple, so brief and so artless could cause so much perplexity at the other end, and such anticipation around the arena. You had to stop. You had to concentrate. </p>
